# Cloudberry

Cloudberry is a static website generator. Using gulp, it will give you live styling/js injection in the browser for development and generates out a static `dist` folder for distribution.

Cloudberry uses [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for templating. 

It is a sister project to Huckleberry, a php website starter kit, containing a set of LESS styles and basic HTML/JS plugins.
